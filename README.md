# SDC-600 Debugger API

The Arm CoreSight [SDC-600 Secure Debug Channel](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/system-ip/coresight-debug-and-trace/coresight-components/coresight-sdc-600-secure-debug-channel), provides a dedicated path to a debugged system for authenticating debug accesses.

The SDC-600 debugger API repository provides the header files necessary for implementations of SDC-600 authentication libraries for debuggers such as Arm Development Studio. A demo of detecting and unlocking the Arm Secure Debug Channel using Arm Development Studio can be viewed [here](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/arm-development-studio/learn/resources/media-articles/2019/04/sdc-600).

Documentation for the APIs can found [here](https://arm-software.github.io/sdc600-debugger/index.html).
